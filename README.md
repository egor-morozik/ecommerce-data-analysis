## Data Analysis Report (RFM Analysis)

### Purpose of Analysis
An analysis of online store customer behavior was performed using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model for segmentation and customer value assessment. Data was extracted from the `transactions` table of the `ecommerce.db` database and processed using a SQL query:
- Recency: Number of days from the customer's last purchase to the last date in the data.
- Frequency: Number of unique orders of the customer.
- Monetary: Total revenue generated by the customer.

### Methodology
- The SQL query grouped the data by `CustomerID`, calculating Recency, Frequency, and Monetary.
- The results were visualized in Power BI using Scatter Plot:
- X-axis: Recency (days).
- Y-axis: Frequency (number of orders).
- Dot size: Monetary (revenue).
- Added filters (Slicer) for interactive analysis by `CustomerID` and `Recency`.

### Key Takeaways
- **Active Customers**: Customers with low Recency (0-30 days) and high Frequency (more than 10 orders) form a cluster in the upper left corner of the graph, indicating loyalty and regular purchases.
- **Valuable Customers**: Dots with a large size (high Monetary, for example, >5000) and low Recency are priority customers for retention.
- **Sleeping Customers**: High Recency (>90 days) with low Frequency and Monetary (small dots on the right) are potential customers for reactivation.
- **Trends**: Correlation between Frequency and Monetary is observed among active customers, confirming their contribution to revenue.

### Recommendations
- Focus on retaining customers with high Monetary and low Recency through personalized offers.
- Develop campaigns to reactivate customers with high Recency (>90 days) and moderate Monetary.
- Add RFM segmentation (scores 1-5) for more accurate customer classification.
